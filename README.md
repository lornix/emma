emma - Like Ida, but linux based.  Ok, maybe that's a lofty, generalized statement... but I'd really like to have a similar tool for linux.  I've used IDAPro briefly in the past, it's a wonderful product.  I have IDAFree5.0 which I use as a source of ideas, but I'm not cribbing code from it in any way.  This is entirely my fault... :)

Still in idea phase I suppose, I'm trying different things to figure out where to dig in, it's chock full of large concepts and information management, somewhat daunting.  I feel I'm just going to have to dive in, make a mess of things for a bit, and see what evolves from that.  Bear with me, please.

email me with any questions, comments, curses, blessings, whatever.
